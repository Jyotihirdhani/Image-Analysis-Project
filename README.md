📰 Print Media Size Automation (PDF-Guided Estimation)
📌 Overview
- This project aims to automate the estimation of real-world print sizes (length × width in cm) for large volumes of newspaper and print media clips.
- In typical agency workflows, teams receive thousands of print clips (images) in ZIP folders and manually calculate their sizes by visually inspecting each clip and entering measurements into Excel — a slow, error-prone, and exhausting process.
- This repository explores and implements a structured, rule-based automation approach inspired by how humans estimate print sizes using newspaper column logic.
