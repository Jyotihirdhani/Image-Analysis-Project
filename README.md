📰 Print Media Size Automation (PDF-Guided Estimation)

📌 Overview
- This project aims to automate the estimation of real-world print sizes (length × width in cm) for large volumes of newspaper and print media clips.
- In typical agency workflows, teams receive thousands of print clips (images) in ZIP folders and manually calculate their sizes by visually inspecting each clip and entering measurements into Excel — a slow, error-prone, and exhausting process.
- This repository explores and implements a structured, rule-based automation approach inspired by how humans estimate print sizes using newspaper column logic.

🎯 Core Problem

Manual workflow today:
- Open each print clip image
- Visually estimate length and width
- Enter values into Excel
- Repeat for ~2000 clips per batch

Pain points:
- Extremely time-consuming
- Mentally exhausting
- Inconsistent measurements across analysts
- Not scalable
Goal of this project:
Reduce manual effort by automating print clip size estimation with 80–90% accuracy, while keeping the logic explainable and aligned with real agency practices.
